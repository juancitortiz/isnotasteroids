# isnotasteroids

My first Phaser3 project. It's a little game very similar to the classic Asteroids.<br>
At the moment it only works on PC, but I plan to keep improving it and adding suport to other platforms.

## How to play:

There are asteroids and all of them are coming for you!!

Controlls on PC:
* **Up** for throttle up.
* **Down** for reverse throttle.
* **Left** & **Right** for turning the ship.
* **Space** for shooting.

You got 5 lives. When you lose them, you're done.<br>
At the end of each gameplay your highscore will be stored in your local browser.<br><br>
Have fun!!!
